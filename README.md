<h1>Too Much Paper - Digital Claims System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
A full-stack system developed for the South Dakota Department of Labor’s Workers’ Compensation division to transition from paper-based injury claims to a secure, searchable digital database. Features include digital claim submission, medical documentation handling, and secure online storage. I contributed to this system as part of a two-semester group project in IS315 Systems Analysis and Design I and IS316 Systems Analysis and Design II. My role included systems analysis, requirements gathering, database design, and front-end/back-end development. Our team followed a structured development process, delivering biweekly progress presentations and final presentations each semester to demonstrate the complete project lifecycle.
